# What information have I gained?
* what type of hashing aggregate was used to protect the password?
* what level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?
* what controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?
* what can you tell about the organization's password policy like password length, key space, etc?
* what would you change in this password policy to make breaking the password harder?
